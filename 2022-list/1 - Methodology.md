# Methodology
### Climate 50 is the most up to date, comprehensive and insightful Global Climate VC ranking for the climate community. 

The Climate 50 ranking methodology was created by Contrarian Ventures. We sought to craft a methodology that would incorporate metrics that define a great investor. We reached beyond traditional financial performance metrics, taking into account the climate community. Your voice also counts.

In the Climate 50 ranking, Venture Capital investors are ranked based on 8 distinct metrics. We have split the metrics into two separate groups; direct and indirect metrics.

**Direct metrics:**
Direct metrics take into account the investment activity of the investor. We used the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) framework, and only included investments that directly and indirectly contribute to the climate change fight by matching with one of the eight SDGs:

1. Clean water and sanitation (#6)
2. Affordable and clean energy (#7)
3. Industry innovation and infrastructure (#9)
4. Sustainable cities and communities (#11)
5. Responsible consumption and production (#12)
6. Climate action (#13)
7. Life below water (#14)
8. Life on land (#15)

There are seven direct investor metrics used in our methodology. Each metric was taken into account while calculating the overall Investor Score. All data for the direct metrics were initially provided by Dealroom.co. and additional data submissions were made by investors. Each direct metric has its own weighting. All seven direct metrics combined represent 90% of the final Investor Score.

**Seven direct metrics are as follows:**
- **Metric #1.** Companies invested (2022): number of investments into new companies in 2022.
- **Metric #2.** Companies invested (last 10 years): number of investments into new companies over the last 10 years.
- **Metric #3.** Portfolio companies (with a valuation from $100M to $1B): number of portfolio companies valued from $100M to $1B.
- **Metric #4.** Exits (2022): number of exits completed by the investor in 2022.
- **Metric #5.** Exits (last 10 years): number of exits completed by the investor in the last 10 years.
- **Metric #6.** Unicorn portfolio companies (with a valuation of $1B+): number of portfolio companies valued over $1B that have Unicorn status.
- **Metric #7.** SDG-related companies invested / total companies invested (2022): Ratio of SDG-related investments to the total number of investments into new companies in 2022.

**Indirect metrics:**
Indirect metrics take into account the non-investment related activity of the investor. One indirect investor metric was taken into account while calculating the overall Investor Score. Each indirect metric has its own weighting. One indirect metric represents 10% of the final Investor Score.

**One indirect metric is as follows:**
- **Metric #8.** Public score: number of public votes cast for the investor by the public on the Climate50.com platform by 7th of May, 2023.

The final Investor Score is derived based on 8 distinct metrics, and investors are ranked accordingly in the final Climate 50 list. The list is dynamic, Metric #10 will change during the voting period, and the final Climate 50 list will be published on the 9th of May 2023. The cut-off time for public votes is the 7th of May, 2023, 23:30 GMT.
